<H1>Carbon Monoxide--Related Deaths --- United States, 1999--2004</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion in 
fuel-burning devices such as motor vehicles, gas-powered furnaces, and portable generators 
(<I><a href="mm5402a2.htm">1</a></I>).<I> </I>Persons with CO poisoning often overlook the symptoms (e.g., headache, nausea, dizziness, or confusion), and undetected exposure can be fatal 
(<I><a href="mm5402a2.htm">1</a></I>). Unintentional CO exposure accounts for an estimated 15,000 emergency department visits and 500 
unintentional deaths in the United States each year 
(<I><a href="mm5402a2.htm">1</a></I>). The most recent state-level estimates of CO-related deaths were described 
in 1991 for the years 1979--1988 (<I>2</I>). Using 
the most recent mortality data available, this report updates national 
and state-specific unintentional, non--fire-related CO mortality rates and describes the 
demographic, seasonal, and geographic patterns<I> 
</I>for 1999--2004. During this period, an average of 439 persons died annually from 
unintentional, non--fire-related CO poisoning, and the national average annual death rate was 1.5 per million persons. However, 
rates varied by&#160;demographic subgroup, month of the year, and 
state.<I> </I>Rates were highest among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years, men, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks. The average number of deaths was highest during January. Among 
the states, Nebraska had the highest reliable CO mortality rate. These findings indicate that improved 
population-based prevention measures, including educating the public about the dangers of CO exposure, are needed at the state 
and national levels.
</P><P>Mortality rates were calculated from death certificate data obtained from the National Vital Statistics System 
(NVSS), using the record axis fields from the multiple cause-of-death files compiled by the National Center for Health 
Statistics (<I>3</I>). Records were searched for all deaths occurring among residents of 50 states and the District of Columbia 
during 1999--2004 that contained <I>International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision </I>(ICD-10) code T58 (toxic effect of 
CO) as a contributing cause of death. A case of unintentional CO-related death was defined as one for which both 
poisoning by accidental exposure to gases or vapors (code X47) and toxic effect of CO (code T58) were listed as causes of death. 
All records of deaths caused by intentional exposure, exposure of undetermined intent, or fire-related 
exposure to CO (codes X00--X09, X76, X97, Y26, and Y17) were excluded. Deaths that occurred among foreign residents in the United 
States and deaths among U.S. residents who died abroad also were excluded. 
</P><P>Crude and age-adjusted rates of unintentional, non--fire-related deaths from CO poisoning were calculated by 
age group, sex, and race/ethnicity for the period 1999--2004. To assess the seasonality of CO-related mortality, the 
average daily number of deaths was calculated by month for the period 1999--2004. The national Non-Notifiable 
Disease Surveillance System was used to identify states in which physicians, laboratories, or hospitals are mandated by law 
to report acute CO poisoning (<I>4</I>). In addition, age-adjusted CO death rates were calculated for each state for the 
period 1999--2004 (<I>5,6</I>)<I>.</I> Populations at risk were defined using the U.S. intercensal population estimate for 1999, the 
U.S. Census 2000 population count, and population bridged-race estimates 
(<I>3</I>) for 2001--2004. Using the direct 
method, state mortality rates were age adjusted to the U.S. standard 2000 population 
(<I>3,5</I>). Rates based on small numbers of deaths (five or fewer) or with relative standard errors (RSEs) &gt;50% were considered unreliable and were not 
included (<I>7</I>). Rates based on &gt;20 deaths and with RSEs &lt;30% were considered reliable. Rates based on six to 29 deaths and 
with RSEs from 30% to 50% should be interpreted with caution. Statistically significant differences between rates 
were inferred by comparing 95% confidence intervals. 
</P><P>During 1999--2004, CO poisoning was listed as a contributing cause of death on 16,447 death certificates in 
the United States. Of these, 16,400 (99.7%) deaths 
occurred among U.S. residents inside the United States, and 
2,631 (16%) were classified as both unintentional and non--fire-related deaths. For the period 1999--2004, an average of 
439 persons died annually from unintentional, non--fire-related CO poisoning (range: 400 in 1999 to 473 in 2003). 
The annual average age-adjusted death rate in the U.S. was 1.5 deaths per million persons 
(<a href = "#tab1">Table 1</a>). Death rates were highest for adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and for men (<a href = "#tab1">Table 1</a>). Age-adjusted death rates were higher for non-Hispanic 
blacks and non-Hispanic whites than for other subgroups; however, the difference between the rates for blacks and whites 
was not statistically significant (<a href = "#tab1">Table 1</a>). The average daily number of CO-related deaths was greatest during the months 
of January (2.07 deaths) and December (1.97 
deaths)<B> </B>and lowest during the months of July (0.67 deaths) and 
August (0.67 deaths). For the period 1999--2004, a total of 35 states had sufficient numbers of CO-related deaths to 
calculate reliable mortality rates (<a href = "#tab2">Table 2</a>). The state with the highest reliable CO mortality rate was Nebraska, and the state 
with the lowest reliable rate was California. As of December 2007, reporting of acute CO poisoning by health-care 
providers 

was mandatory for 13 states; no clear pattern of differences in CO-related mortality was detected between states 
with mandatory reporting and those without. 
</P><P><B>Reported by:</B><I> M King, PhD, C Bailey, MS, National Center for Environmental Health, CDC.</I>
<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> Consistent with previous studies 
(<I><a href="mm5402a2.htm">1</a>,2</I>), the results of this analysis indicate that men and adults 
aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years were more likely to die from CO poisoning than other persons. The higher rate in men has been attributed 
to high-risk behaviors among men, such as working with fuel-burning tools or appliances. The higher rate among 
older persons has been attributed to the likelihood of older 
adults mistaking symptoms of CO poisoning for other 
conditions common among persons in this age group (e.g., influenza-like illnesses or fatigue. CO deaths were highest during 
colder months, likely because of increased use of gas-powered furnaces and use of alternative heating and power sources 
used during power outages, such as portable generators, charcoal briquettes, and propane stoves or grills 
(<I><a href="mm5402a2.htm">1</a></I>)<I>. </I>Similar to previous findings 
(<I>2</I>), the highest CO death rates tended to be among western (e.g., Alaska, Montana, and 
Wyoming) and midwestern (e.g., Nebraska and North Dakota) states, likely because of variations in weather and geography 
and state-by-state variations in prevalence of certain risk behaviors.
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, carboxyhemoglobin measurements are not 
a routine part of autopsies, and postmortem measurements often are unreliable because carboxyhemoglobin 
concentrations produced by different analytic methods vary 
(<I>8</I>), which might have resulted in misclassification of 
CO-related deaths. In addition, receipt of mortality data often is 
delayed, and the data might lack the circumstantial and clinical detail 
that could provide information about the specific mechanisms of 
CO poisoning, which might have resulted in 
misclassification. Second, because the symptoms of CO poisoning are nonspecific and clinical recognition is 
challenging, certain cases might not be recognized, resulting in underestimates. Finally, because ICD-10 coding has only one 
code specific to CO (T58), distinguishing between deaths caused by motor-vehicle exhaust and other CO-related deaths 
is not possible using the methods in this analysis. 
</P><P>Because persons are relying on CO alarms to prevent CO poisoning 
(<I><a href="mm5309a1.htm">9</a></I>), additional research regarding their effectiveness is needed, including an evaluation of the cost effectiveness of CO alarms used in 
residences. As additional years of data become available, tracking of longitudinal trends in 
CO-related mortality should continue to guide 
public health measures aimed at preventing deaths from CO poisoning 
(<I>10</I>). 
</P><P>Exposure to CO can be prevented with basic precautions, including proper installation and maintenance of 
fuel-burning appliances (<a href = "#box">Box</a>). CO detectors can alert occupants to accumulating gas and should be placed on every level of 
a home. Additional measures to educate the public regarding the dangers of CO are needed, particularly during 
the winter season. Additional surveillance that combines timely estimates of morbidity and mortality with 
situational information related to mechanisms of CO exposure (e.g., length of exposure, type of fuel-burning device 
involved, and behaviors or chain of events preceding exposure) could help target prevention measures and reduce CO poisonings.
