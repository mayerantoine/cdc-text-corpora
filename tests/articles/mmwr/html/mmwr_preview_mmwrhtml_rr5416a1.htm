</H3>
</P><P><I>This report is the first of a two-part statement from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
that updates the strategy to eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in the United States. The report provides 
updated recommendations to improve prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV transmission, including implementation 
of universal infant vaccination beginning at birth, and to increase vaccine coverage among previously unvaccinated children 
and adolescents. Strategies to enhance implementation of the recommendations include 1) establishing standing orders 
for administration of hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth; 2) instituting delivery hospital policies and procedures and 
case management programs to improve identification of and administration of immunoprophylaxis to infants born to mothers 
who 
are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery; and 
3) implementing vaccination record reviews for all children aged 11--12 years and children and adolescents aged &lt;19 years 
who were born in countries with intermediate and high levels of HBV endemicity, adopting hepatitis B vaccine requirements 
for school entry, and integrating hepatitis B vaccination services into settings that serve adolescents. The second part of the 
ACIP statement, which will include updated recommendations and strategies to increase hepatitis B vaccination of adults, will 
be published separately.</I>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Strategy to Eliminate Hepatitis B Virus Transmission</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P> Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a bloodborne and sexually transmitted virus. Rates of new infection and acute disease are 
highest among adults, but chronic infection is more likely to occur in persons infected as infants or young children. Before hepatitis 
B vaccination programs became routine in the United States, an estimated 30%--40% of chronic 
infections are believed to have resulted from perinatal or early childhood transmission, even though &lt;10% of reported cases of hepatitis B occurred 
in children aged &lt;10 years (<I>1</I>). Chronically infected persons are at increased lifetime risk for cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and also serve as the main reservoir for continued HBV transmission.
</P><P>Hepatitis B vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent HBV infection and its consequences. Since they were 
first issued in 1982, recommendations for hepatitis B vaccination have evolved into a comprehensive strategy to eliminate 
HBV transmission in the United States (<I><a href="00001116.htm">2</a>--<a href="00056293.htm">6</a></I>) 
(<a href = "#box1">Box 1</a>). A primary focus of this strategy is universal vaccination of 
infants to prevent early childhood HBV infection and to eventually protect adolescents and adults from infection. Other components 
include routine screening of all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and postexposure immunoprophylaxis 
of infants born to HBsAg-positive women, vaccination of children and adolescents who were not previously vaccinated, 
and vaccination of unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection.
</P><P>To date, the immunization strategy has been implemented with considerable success. Recent estimates indicate that &gt;95% 
of pregnant women are tested for HBsAg, and case management has been effective in ensuring high levels of initiation 
and 
</P><P>
</P><P>
completion of postexposure immunoprophylaxis among identified infants born to HBsAg-positive women 
(<I><a href="00042966.htm">7</a></I>). Hepatitis B vaccine has been successfully integrated into the childhood vaccine schedule, and infant vaccine coverage levels are 
now equivalent to those of other vaccines in the childhood schedule. During 1990--2004, incidence of acute hepatitis B in 
the United States declined 75%. The greatest decline (94%) occurred among children and adolescents, coincident with an 
increase in hepatitis B vaccine coverage. As of 2004, among U.S. children aged 19--35 months, &gt;92% had been fully vaccinated with 
3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (<I><a href="mm5429a1.htm">8</a></I>). This success can be attributed in part to the established infrastructure for vaccine delivery 
to children and to federal support for perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs.
</P><P>Vaccine coverage among adolescents has also increased substantially. Preliminary data demonstrate that 50%--60% 
of adolescents aged 13--15 years have records indicating vaccination (with 3 doses) against hepatitis B (CDC, unpublished 
data, 2003). As of November 2005, a total of 34 states require vaccination for middle-school entry 
(<I>9</I>). Certain programs provide hepatitis B vaccine to youth who engage in behaviors that place them at high risk for HBV infection (i.e., injection-drug 
use, having more than one sex partner, and male sexual activity with other males), and adolescent hepatitis B vaccination 
is included as a Health Plan Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS) measure 
(<I>10</I>).
</P><P>Despite these successes, challenges remain. Even with 
improvements in the management of pregnant women, 
only approximately 50% of expected births to HBsAg-positive women are identified (on the basis of application of 
racial/ethnic-specific HBsAg prevalence estimates to U.S. natality data) for case management, which maximizes timely delivery 
of postexposure immunoprophylaxis (<I>11</I>; CDC, unpublished data, 2004). The need for proper management of women 
without prenatal care, including HBsAg testing at the time of admission for delivery and administration of the first dose of vaccine 
to infants &lt;12 hours of birth, is underscored by the higher prevalence of HBsAg seropositivity among these women than 
among women who are screened prenatally (<I>12</I>). Even when maternal HBsAg testing does occur, certain infants of 
HBsAg-positive mothers do not receive postexposure immunoprophylaxis because of testing errors and lapses in reporting of test results 
(<I>13</I>), and infants of women with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery often do not receive a birth dose of vaccine 
(<I>14</I>). Birth dose coverage in 2004 was only 46% (National Immunization Survey, unpublished data, 2004), and coverage has 
not returned to levels from before July 1999 (54%), when recommendations were made to temporarily suspend administration 
of hepatitis B vaccines at birth until vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative became available 
(<I>15</I>). Among adolescents, efforts to prevent HBV transmission are hampered by the low rate of health-care visits in this age group 
compared with that of young children and the frequency of initiation of high-risk behaviors.
</P><P>To address these remaining challenges and accelerate progress toward elimination of HBV transmission in the United States, 
the ACIP has updated the hepatitis B immunization recommendations for infants, children, and adolescents and supplemented 
the recommendations with strategies for implementation. The recommendations and implementation strategies address prevention 
of perinatal and early childhood transmission and routine vaccination of children and adolescents. A main focus is on 
universal infant vaccination beginning at birth, which provides a &quot;safety net&quot; for prevention of perinatal infection, prevents early 
childhood infections, facilitates implementation of universal vaccination recommendations, and prevents infections in adolescents 
and adults. The second part of the ACIP statement, which includes updated recommendations and implementation strategies 
to increase hepatitis B vaccination among unvaccinated adults, will be published separately 
(<I>16</I>).

<B>Clinical Features and Natural History of HBV Infection</B>
</H4>
</P><P>HBV is a 42-nm DNA virus classified in the 
<I>Hepadnaviridae</I> family. The liver is the primary site of HBV replication. After 
a susceptible person is exposed, the virus enters the liver via the bloodstream; no evidence exists indicating that the 
virus replicates at mucosal surfaces. HBV infection can produce either asymptomatic or symptomatic infection. The 
average incubation period is 90 days (range: 60--150 days) from 
exposure to onset of jaundice and 60 days (range: 40--90 days) 
from exposure to onset of abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 
(<I>17,18</I>).
</P><P>The onset of acute disease is usually insidious. Infants and young children (aged &lt;10 years) are typically asymptomatic 
(<I>19</I>). When present, clinical symptoms and signs might 
include anorexia, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
jaundice. Extrahepatic manifestations of disease (e.g., skin rashes, arthralgias, and arthritis) also can occur 
(<I>20</I>). The fatality rate among persons with reported acute hepatitis B is 0.5%--1.5%, with highest rates in adults aged &gt;60 years 
(<I>21</I>)<I>.</I>
</P><P>Although the consequences of acute hepatitis B can be 
severe, the majority of serious sequelae associated with HBV 
disease occur in persons who are chronically infected. Persons with chronic infection also serve as the major reservoir for 
continued HBV transmission. Chronic infection occurs in approximately 90% of infected infants, 30% of infected children aged 
&lt;5 years, and &lt;5% of infected persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>5 years, with continuing viral replication in the liver and persistent viremia 
(<I>19,22--24</I>)<B>. </B>Primary infections also become chronic more frequently in immunosuppressed persons (e.g., hemodialysis patients 
and persons with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) 
(<I>23,25,26</I>). On the basis of data from follow-up studies 
of persons infected with HBV as infants or young children, approximately 25% of those with chronic infection die 
prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer; the majority remain asymptomatic until onset of cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease 
(<I>27--29</I>).
</P><P>No specific treatment exists for acute hepatitis B. Persons who have chronic HBV infection require medical evaluation 
and regular monitoring (<I>30,31</I>). Therapeutic agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment 
of chronic hepatitis B can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease in certain persons 
(<I>31</I>). Periodic screening with alfa fetoprotein or imaging studies has been demonstrated to enhance early detection of HCC 
(<I>31</I>). Chronically infected persons with HCC have been reported to have experienced long-term survival after resection or 
ablation of small HCCs, and persons who were screened had a substantial survival advantage compared with historic controls 
(<I>31</I>).
</P><P>Reinfection or reactivation of latent HBV infection has been reported among certain groups of immunosuppressed 
persons, including renal transplant recipients, HIV-infected patients, bone marrow transplant recipients, and patients 
receiving chemotherapy (<I>32--35</I>). The frequency with which this phenomenon occurs is unknown.
<H4>
<B>Interpretation of Serologic Markers of HBV Infection</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The antigens and antibodies associated with HBV infection include HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), hepatitis 
B core antigen (HBcAg) and antibody to HBcAg (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to HBeAg 
(anti-HBe). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of HBV infection 
(<a href = "#tab1">Table 1</a>) (<I>18,36</I>). Serologic assays are commercially available for all markers 
except HBcAg because no free HBcAg circulates in blood.
</P><P>The presence of a confirmed HBsAg result is indicative of ongoing HBV infection. All HBsAg-positive persons should 
be considered infectious. In newly infected persons, HBsAg is the only serologic marker detected during the first 3--5 weeks 
after infection, and it persists for variable periods at very low levels. The average time from exposure to detection of HBsAg is 
30 days (range: 6--60 days) (<I>17,18</I>). Highly sensitive single-sample nucleic acid tests can detect HBV DNA in the serum of 
an infected person 10--20 days before detection of HBsAg 
(<I>37</I>). Transient HBsAg positivity has been reported for up to 18 
days after vaccination and is clinically insignificant 
(<I>38,39</I>).
</P><P>Anti-HBc appears at the onset of symptoms or liver test abnormalities in acute HBV infection and persists for life. Acute 
or recently acquired infection can be distinguished by the presence of the IgM class of anti-HBc, which is detected at the onset 
of acute hepatitis B and persists for up to 6 months if the disease resolves. In patients who develop chronic hepatitis B, IgM 
anti-HBc can persist at low levels during viral replication and can result in positive tests for IgM anti-HBc 
(<I>40</I>). In addition, false-positive IgM anti-HBc test results can occur. Because the positive predictive value is low in asymptomatic persons, 
for diagnosis of acute hepatitis B, testing for IgM anti-HBc should be limited to persons with clinical evidence of acute 
hepatitis or an epidemiologic link to a case.
</P><P>In persons who recover from HBV infection, HBsAg is eliminated from the blood, usually within 3--4 months, and 
anti-HBs develops during convalescence. The presence of anti-HBs typically indicates immunity from HBV infection. Infection 
or immunization with one genotype of HBV confers immunity to all genotypes. In addition, anti-HBs can be detected for 
several months after hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) administration. The majority of persons who recover from 
natural infection will be positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc, whereas persons who respond to hepatitis B vaccine have only 
anti-HBs. In persons who become chronically infected, HBsAg and anti-HBc persist, typically for life. HBsAg will 
become undetectable in approximately 0.5%--2% of chronically infected persons yearly, and anti-HBs will occur in the majority 
of these persons (<I>41--44</I>).
</P><P>In certain persons, the only HBV serologic marker detected in serum is anti-HBc. Isolated anti-HBc can occur after 
HBV infection among persons who have recovered but whose anti-HBs levels have waned or among persons in whom 
anti-HBs failed to occur. Persons in the latter category include those with circulating HBsAg levels not detectable by commercial 
assays. These persons are unlikely to be infectious except 
under circumstances in which they are the source for direct 
percutaneous exposure of susceptible recipients to substantial quantities of virus (e.g., through blood transfusion or following 
liver transplantation) (<I>45</I>)<B>.</B> HBV DNA has been detected in the blood of &lt;5% of persons with isolated anti-HBc 
(<I>46</I>). Typically, the frequency of isolated anti-HBc relates directly to the prevalence of HBV infection in the population. In populations with 
a high prevalence of HBV infection, isolated anti-HBc likely indicates previous infection, with loss of anti-HBs. For persons 
in populations with a low prevalence of HBV infection, an isolated anti-HBc result often represents a false-positive reaction. 
The majority of these persons have a primary anti-HBs response after a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine 
(<I>47,48</I>). Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who do not become infected might have detectable anti-HBc for 
<U>&lt;</U>24 months after birth from passively transferred maternal antibody.
</P><P>HBeAg can be detected in the serum of persons with acute or chronic HBV infection. The presence of HBeAg 
correlates with viral replication and high levels of virus (i.e., high infectivity) 
(<I>49,50</I>). Anti-HBe correlates with the loss of 
replicating virus and with lower levels of virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity has been observed 
(<I>44</I>).
<H4>
<B>Epidemiology of HBV Infection</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>Transmission</B>
</P><P>HBV is transmitted by percutaneous (i.e., puncture through the skin) or mucosal (i.e., direct contact with 
mucous membranes) exposure to infectious blood or to body fluids that contain blood. All HBsAg-positive persons are infectious, 
but those who are also HBeAg positive are more infectious 
because their blood contains high titers of HBV (typically 
10<SUP>7</SUP>--10<SUP>9</SUP> virions/mL) 
(<I>49,50</I>). Although HBsAg has been detected in multiple body fluids, only serum, semen, and saliva have 
been demonstrated to be infectious (<I>51,52</I>). HBV is comparatively stable in the environment and remains viable for 
<U>&gt;</U>7 days on environmental surfaces at room temperature 
(<I>53</I>). HBV at concentrations of 
10<SUP>2--3</SUP> virions/mL can be present on environmental surfaces in the absence of any visible blood and still cause transmission 
(<I>53,54</I>).
</P><P>For infants and children, the two primary sources of HBV infection are perinatal transmission from infected mothers 
and horizontal transmission from infected household contacts. Adolescents are at risk for HBV infection primarily through 
high-risk sexual activity (i.e., sex with more than one partner and male sexual activity with other males) and injection-drug use 
(<I>21</I>). Transmission of HBV via transfusion of blood and plasma-derived products is rare because of donor screening for HBsAg 
and viral inactivation procedures.
</P><P>For a newborn infant whose mother is positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg, the risk for chronic HBV infection is 
70%--90%<B> </B>by age 6 months in the absence of postexposure immunoprophylaxis 
(<I>55--57</I>). For infants of women who are 
HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative, the risk for chronic 
infection is &lt;10% in the absence of postexposure immunoprophylaxis 
(<I>58--60</I>). Rare cases of fulminant hepatitis B among perinatally infected infants also have been reported 
(<I><a href="mm5006a3.htm">61</a>,62</I>). Studies suggest that breastfeeding by an 
HBsAg-positive mother does not increase the risk for acquisition of HBV infection in the infant 
(<I>63</I>).
</P><P>Children who are not infected at birth remain at risk from long-term interpersonal contact with their infected mothers. 
In one study, 38% of infants who were born to 
HBsAg-positive mothers and who were not infected perinatally 
became infected by age 4 years (<I>64</I>). In addition, children living with any chronically infected persons are at risk for 
becoming infected through percutaneous or mucosal exposures to blood or infectious body fluids (e.g., sharing a toothbrush, contact with exudates 
from dermatologic lesions, contact with HBsAg-contaminated surfaces). HBV transmission rates to susceptible household 
contacts 

of chronically infected persons have varied (range: 14%--60%) 
(<I>65,66</I>). High rates of infection also have been reported 
among unvaccinated long-term residents of institutions for the mentally handicapped 
(<I>67,68</I>), and, in rare instances, person-to-person transmission has been reported in child care settings 
(<I>69,70</I>).
</P><P>
<B>Incidence</B>
</P><P>During 1990--2004, overall incidence of reported acute hepatitis B declined 75%, from 8.5 to 2.1 per 100,000 
population. The most dramatic declines occurred in the cohort of children to whom recommendations for routine infant and 
adolescent vaccination have applied. Incidence among children aged &lt;12 years and adolescents aged 12--19 years 
declined 94%, from 1.1 to 0.36 and 6.1 to 2.8 per 100,000 population, respectively 
(<a href = "#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Since implementation of routine 
childhood immunization, an estimated 6,800 perinatal infections and an additional 18,700 infections during the first 10 years of 
life have been prevented annually in the United States 
(<I>71</I>).
</P><P>Although infections in infants and children aged &lt;10 years represented &lt;10% of all HBV infections before 
implementation of childhood immunization programs, childhood infections resulted in an estimated 30%--40% of the chronic 
HBV infections among persons who acquired their infections in the United States 
(<I>1</I>). In two population-based studies 
conducted among Asian/Pacific Islander children who were born in the United States before perinatal hepatitis B prevention 
programs were widely implemented, 61%--66% of the chronic HBV infections occurred in children born to HBsAg-negative 
mothers (<I>72,73</I>). A substantial proportion of these chronic infections would not have been prevented by a selective program 
of identification and immunization of only infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.
</P><P>In addition to declines in incidence among all age groups, racial disparities in hepatitis B incidence among children 
have been substantially reduced (<a href = "#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The reduction of the disparity between Asian/Pacific Islander and other children 
is consistent with recent observations noting a decline in seroprevalence of HBV infection after successful implementation 
of routine hepatitis B vaccination among Asians who have recently immigrated to the United States 
(<I>74,75</I>). However, as hepatitis B incidence has declined among U.S.-born children, unvaccinated foreign-born children account for a 
high proportion of infections. During 2001--2002, of 
19<B> </B>children born after 1991 in whom acute hepatitis B had been 
verified, eight (42%) were foreign born (<I><a href="mm5343a4.htm">76</a></I>).
</P><P>
<B>Prevalence</B>
</P><P>In the U.S. population, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of HBV infection (including persons with chronic infection 
and those with previous infection) was 4.9% in the third 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 
III, 1988--1994) (<I>77</I>). Foreign-born persons (particularly Asian/Pacific Islanders) who have emigrated from countries in 
which HBV is endemic (<a href = "#fig1">Figure 1</a> and <a href = "#box2">Box 2</a>) contribute disproportionately to the burden of chronic HBV infection in the 
United States. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection among foreign-born persons immigrating to the United States from 
Central and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa varies (range: 5%--15%) and reflects the patterns of HBV infection in 
the countries and regions of origin for these persons. During 1994--2003, approximately 40,000 immigrants with chronic 
HBV infection were admitted annually to the United States for permanent residence 
(<I>78</I>; CDC, unpublished data, 2005).

<B>Hepatitis B Vaccine</B>
</H4>
</P><P>HBsAg is the antigen used for hepatitis B vaccination 
(<I>79,80</I>). Vaccine antigen can be purified from the plasma of 
persons with chronic HBV infection or produced by recombinant DNA technology. Vaccines available in the United States 
use recombinant DNA technology to express HBsAg in yeast, which is then purified from the cells by biochemical and 
biophysical separation techniques (<I>81,82</I>). Hepatitis B vaccines licensed in the United States are formulated to contain 
10--40 <I>&#181;</I>g of HBsAg protein/mL. Since March 2000, hepatitis B vaccines produced for distribution in the United States do not 
contain thimerosal as a preservative or contain only a trace amount (&lt;1.0 mcg mercury/mL) from the manufacturing process 
(<I><a href="mm4826a3.htm">83</a>,<a href="m4928a4.htm">84</a></I>).
</P><P>Hepatitis B vaccine is available as a single-antigen formulation and also in fixed combination with other vaccines. 
Two single-antigen vaccines are available in the United States: Recombivax 
HB<SUP>&#174;</SUP> (Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, 
New Jersey) and Engerix-B<SUP>&#174;</SUP> (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium). Of the three licensed combination vaccines, 
one (Twinrix<SUP>&#174;</SUP> [GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium]) is used for vaccination of adults, and two 
(Comvax<SUP>&#174;</SUP> [Merck &amp; 

Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey] and 
Pediarix<SUP>&#174;</SUP> [GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium]) are used 
for vaccination of infants and young children. Twinrix contains recombinant HBsAg and inactivated hepatitis A 
virus. Comvax contains recombinant HBsAg and <I>Haemophilus 
influenzae</I> type b (Hib) polyribosylribitol phosphate conjugated to 
<I>Neisseria meningitidis</I> outer membrane protein complex. Pediarix contains recombinant HBsAg, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids 
and acellular pertussis adsorbed (DTaP), and inactivated poliovirus (IPV).
<H4>
<B>HBIG</B>
</H4>
</P><P>HBIG provides passively acquired anti-HBs and temporary protection (i.e., 3--6 months) when administered in 
standard doses. HBIG is typically used as an adjunct to hepatitis B vaccine for postexposure immunoprophylaxis to prevent 
HBV infection. HBIG administered alone is the primary means of protection after an HBV exposure for nonresponders to 
hepatitis B vaccination.
</P><P>HBIG is prepared from the plasma of donors with high concentrations of anti-HBs. The plasma is screened to 
eliminate donors who are positive for HBsAg, antibodies to HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HCV RNA. In addition, 
proper manufacturing techniques for HBIG inactivate viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV, and HIV) from the final product 
(<I><a href="00000715.htm">85</a>,86</I>). No evidence exists that HBV, HCV, or HIV ever has been transmitted by HBIG commercially available in the United 
States. HBIG that is commercially available in the United States does not contain thimerosal.

</H3>
<H4>
<B>Preexposure Vaccination</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>Infants and Children</B>
</P><P>Primary vaccination consists of <U>&gt;</U>3 intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine 
(<a href = "#tab2">Table 2</a>). Vaccine schedules for infants and children 
(<a href="#tab3">Tables 3</a>--<a href="#tab5">5</a>) are determined on the basis of immunogenicity 
data and the need to integrate hepatitis B vaccine into 
a harmonized childhood vaccination schedule. Although not all possible schedules for each product have been evaluated 
in clinical trials, available licensed formulations for both single-antigen vaccines produce high (&gt;95%) levels of 
seroprotection among infants and children when administered 
in multiple schedules (<I>87--91</I>).
</P><P>The immunogenicity of the combined hepatitis B-Hib conjugate vaccine (Comvax) and the combined hepatitis 
B-DTaP-IPV vaccine (Pediarix) is equivalent to that of their individual antigens administered separately. However, these 
vaccines cannot be administered to infants aged &lt;6 weeks; only single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine may be used for the birth dose. 
Use of 4-dose hepatitis B vaccine schedules, including schedules with a birth dose, has not increased vaccine reactogenicity 
(<I>92,93</I>). Anti-HBs responses after a 3-dose series of hepatitis B-containing combination vaccines among infants who were 
previously vaccinated at birth with single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine are comparable to those observed after a 3-dose series 
of combination vaccine without a birth dose 
(<I>93</I>).
</P><P>
<B>Birth Dose</B>
</P><P>Hepatitis B vaccine can be administered soon after birth with only minimal decrease in immunogenicity, compared 
with administration at older ages, and no decrease in protective efficacy 
(<I>87</I>). Administration of a birth dose of hepatitis B 
vaccine is required for effective postexposure 
immuno-prophylaxis to prevent perinatal HBV infection. Although 
infants who require postexposure immunoprophylaxis should be identified by maternal HBsAg testing, administering a birth dose to infants 
even without HBIG serves as a &quot;safety net&quot; to prevent perinatal infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers who 
are not identified because of errors in maternal HBsAg testing or failures in reporting of test results 
(<I>13</I>). The birth dose also provides early protection to infants at risk for infection after the perinatal period. Administration of a birth dose has 
been associated with higher rates of on-time completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series 
(<I>15,94</I>). In certain populations, the birth dose has been associated with improved completion rates for all other infant vaccines 
(<I>95</I>), although findings have not been consistent 
(<I>15,94</I>).
</P><P>
<B>Adolescents</B>
</P><P>Recommended vaccination schedules for adolescents balance available immunogenicity data with the need to 
achieve compliance with vaccination in this age group (<a href="#tab2">Tables 2</a> and 
		<a href="#tab5">5</a>). Both licensed single-antigen hepatitis B vaccines 
administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months produce a &gt;95% sero-protection rate in adolescents. Equivalent seroprotection rates 
are achieved among adolescents vaccinated at 0, 1--2, and 4 months and 0, 12, and 24 months. The adult (10 
<I>&#181;</I>g) dose of Recombivax-HB administered in a 2-dose schedule to children and adolescents aged 11--15 years at 0 and 4--6 
months produces antibody levels equivalent to those obtained with the 
5-<I>&#181;</I>g dose administered on a 3-dose schedule 
(<I>96,<a href="mm4912a5.htm">97</a></I>). However, no data on long-term antibody persistence or protection are available for 2-dose schedules. No combination 
vaccines containing hepatitis B vaccine antigen are approved for use in adolescents aged 11--17 years.
</P><P>
<B>Nonstandard Vaccine Schedules</B>
</P><P>No apparent effect on immunogenicity has been documented when minimum spacing of doses is not achieved 
precisely. Increasing the interval between the first 2 doses has little effect on immunogenicity or final antibody concentration 
(<I>98--100</I>). The third dose confers the maximum level of seroprotection but acts primarily as a booster and appears to provide optimal 
long-term protection (<I>101</I>). Longer intervals between the last 2 doses result in higher final antibody levels but might increase the 
risk for acquisition of HBV infection among persons who have a delayed response to vaccination. No differences 
in immunogenicity have been observed when 1 or 2 doses of hepatitis B vaccine produced by one manufacturer are followed 
by doses from a different manufacturer (<I>102</I>).
</P><P>
<B>Response to Revaccination</B>
</P><P>A study of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers who did not respond to a primary vaccine series indicated that all 
those not infected with HBV responded satisfactorily to a 
repeat 3-dose revaccination series (<I>103</I>). No data suggest that 
children who have no detectable antibody after 6 doses of vaccine would benefit from additional doses.
</P><P>
<B>Groups Requiring Different Vaccination Doses or Schedules</B>
</P><P><b>Preterm infants.</b> Preterm infants weighing &lt;2,000 g at birth have a decreased response to hepatitis B vaccine 
administered before age 1 month (<I>104--106</I>). By age 1 month, medically stable preterm infants, regardless of initial birth weight 
or gestational age, have a response to vaccination that is comparable to that of full-term infants 
(<I>107--110</I>).
</P><P><b>Hemodialysis patients and other immunocompromised persons.</b> 
Although data concerning the response of pediatric hemodialysis patients to vaccination with standard pediatric doses are lacking, protective levels of antibody occur in 
75%--97% of those who receive higher dosages 
(20-<I>&#181;</I>g) on either the 3- or the 4-dose 
schedule (<I>111--114</I>). Humoral response to hepatitis B vaccination is also reduced in other children and adolescents who are immunocompromised 
(e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, patients undergoing chemotherapy, and HIV-infected persons) 
(<I>115--119</I>). Modified dosing regimens, including a doubling of the standard antigen dose or administration of additional doses, 
might increase response rates (<I>120</I>). However, data on response to these alternative vaccination schedules are limited 
(<I>121</I>).
</P><P>
<B>Immune Memory</B>
</P><P>Anti-HBs is the only easily measurable correlate of vaccine-induced protection. Immunocompetent persons who achieve 
anti-HBs concentrations <U>&gt;</U>10 mIU/mL after preexposure vaccination have virtually complete protection against both acute disease 
and chronic infection even if anti-HBs concentrations 
subsequently decline to &lt;10 mIU/mL 
(<I>122--125</I>). Although immunogenicity is lower among immunocompromised persons, those who achieve and maintain a protective antibody response before 
exposure to HBV have a high level of protection from infection.
</P><P>After primary immunization with hepatitis B vaccine, anti-HBs 
concentrations decline rapidly within the first year and 
more slowly thereafter. Among children who respond to a primary vaccine series with antibody levels 
<U>&gt;</U>10 mIU/mL, 15%--50% have low or undetectable 
concentrations of anti-HBs (anti-HBs loss) 5--15 years after vaccination 
(<I>126--130</I>). The persistence of detectable anti-HBs after vaccination, in the 
absence of exposure to HBV, depends on the level of postvaccination 
antibody concentration.
</P><P>Despite declines in anti-HBs to &lt;10 mIU/mL, nearly all vaccinated persons are still protected against HBV infection. 
The mechanism for continued vaccine-induced protection is thought to be the preservation of immune memory through 
selective expansion and differentiation of clones of antigen-specific B and T lymphocytes 
(<I>131</I>). Persistence of vaccine-induced 
immune 

memory among persons who responded to a primary childhood vaccine series 13--23 years earlier but then had levels of 
anti-HBs below 10 mIU/mL has been demonstrated by an anamnestic increase in anti-HBs levels in 67%--76% of these persons 
2--4 weeks after administration of an additional vaccine dose 
(<I>132,133</I>). Although direct measurement of immune memory 
is not yet possible, these data indicate that a high proportion of vaccine recipients 
retain immune memory and would develop an anti-HBs 
response upon exposure to HBV.
</P><P>Studies of cohorts of immunocompetent persons vaccinated as children or infants also indicate that, despite anti-HBs 
loss years after immunization, nearly all vaccinated persons who respond to a primary series remain protected from HBV 
infection. No clinical cases of hepatitis B have been observed in follow-up studies conducted 15--20 years after vaccination 
among immunocompetent vaccinated persons with antibody levels 
<U>&gt;</U>10 mIU/mL. Certain studies have documented 
breakthrough infections (detected by the presence of anti-HBc or HBV DNA) in a limited percentage of vaccinated persons 
(<I>130,131</I>), but these infections are usually transient and 
asymptomatic; chronic infections have been documented only rarely 
(<I>134</I>). Breakthrough infections resulting in chronic 
infection have been observed only among vaccinated infants born to 
HBsAg-positive women.
</P><P>Limited data are available on the duration of immune memory after hepatitis B vaccination in 
immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV-infected patients, dialysis patients, patients undergoing chemotherapy, or hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant patients). No clinically important HBV infections have been documented among immunocompromised 
persons who maintain protective levels of anti-HBs. In studies of long-term protection among HIV-infected persons, 
breakthrough infections occurring after a decline in anti-HBs concentrations to &lt;10 mIU/mL have been transient and asymptomatic 
(<I>135</I>)<B>. </B>However, among hemodialysis patients who respond to the vaccine, clinically significant HBV infection has been 
documented in persons who have not maintained anti-HBs concentrations of 
<U>&gt;</U>10 mIU/mL (<I>136</I>).
<H4>
<B>Postexposure Prophylaxis</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Both passive-active postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine and active PEP with hepatitis 
B vaccine alone have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing transmission after exposure to HBV 
(<I>137--140</I>). HBIG alone has also been demonstrated to be effective in preventing HBV transmission 
(<I>141--144</I>), but with the availability of hepatitis B vaccine, HBIG typically is used as an adjunct to vaccination.
</P><P>The major determinant of the effectiveness of PEP is early administration of the initial dose of vaccine. The effectiveness 
of PEP diminishes the longer it is initiated after exposure 
(<I>17,145,146</I>). Studies are limited on the maximum interval 
after exposure during which PEP is effective, but the interval is unlikely to exceed 7 days for perinatal 
(<I>147</I>) and needlestick (<I>140--142</I>) exposures and 14 days for sexual exposures 
(<I>122, 138,139,143,144</I>).
</P><P>No data are available on the efficacy of HBsAg-containing combination vaccines when used to complete the vaccine series 
for PEP, but the efficacy of combination vaccines is expected to be similar to that of single-antigen vaccines because the 
HBsAg component induces a comparable anti-HBs response.
</P><P>
<B>Perinatal HBV Exposure</B>
</P><P><b>Passive-active PEP.</b> PEP with hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG administered 12--24 hours after birth, followed by 
completion of a 3-dose vaccine series, has been demonstrated to be 85%--95% effective in preventing acute and chronic HBV infection 
in infants born to women who are positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg 
(<I>137</I>). Although clinical trials have evaluated the 
efficacy of passive-active PEP with hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG administered only within 24 hours of birth, studies of 
passive immunoprophylaxis have demonstrated that HBIG provided protection when administered as late as 72 hours after 
exposure. The majority of clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of passive-active PEP when the second vaccine dose was 
administered at age 1 month (<I>137</I>). Administration of HBIG plus vaccine at birth, 1 month, and 6 months and at birth, 2 months, and 
6 months has demonstrated comparable efficacy in prevention of acute and chronic infection among infants born to 
women who were both HBsAg and HBeAg positive (Cladd E. Stevens, MD, New York Blood Center, personal 
communication, 1994).
</P><P>Infants born to HBsAg-positive/HBeAg-negative mothers who receive passive-active PEP with HBIG and hepatitis 
B vaccine should have the same high degree of protection as infants born to women who are HBsAg positive/HBeAg 
positive. However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been examined in controlled clinical trials because the low infection rate 
would require an unattainable sample size.
</P><P><b>Active PEP.</b> Active PEP with hepatitis B vaccine alone (i.e., without HBIG) is frequently used in certain remote areas 
(e.g., Alaska and the Pacific Islands) where implementation of 
maternal HBsAg testing is difficult because no access exists to 
a laboratory. In randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, administration of hepatitis B vaccine in a 3- or 4-dose 
schedule without HBIG beginning <U>&lt;</U>12 hours after birth has been demonstrated to prevent 70%--95% of perinatal HBV 
infections among infants born to women who are positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg 
(<I>58,148--152</I>). Population-based studies in 
areas with a high endemicity of HBV infection have demonstrated that active postexposure vaccination is highly effective 
in preventing infection when the first dose is administered soon after birth, the second at age 1--2 months, and the third at 
age 6--8 months (<I>153--155</I>).
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Vaccine Safety</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>Hepatitis B vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe when administered to infants, children, adolescents, and 
adults. Since 1982, an estimated &gt;60 million adolescents and adults and &gt;40 million infants and children have been vaccinated in 
the United States.
<H4>
<B>Vaccine Reactogenicity</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The most frequently reported side effects among persons receiving hepatitis B vaccine are pain at the injection 
site (3%--29%) and fever &gt;99.9&#176; F<B> </B>(&gt;37.7&#176; C) (1%--6%) 
(<I>156,157</I>). However, in placebo-controlled studies, these side 
effects were reported no more frequently among persons 
receiving hepatitis B vaccine than among persons receiving placebo 
(<I>87</I>). Administration of hepatitis B vaccine soon after birth has not been associated with an increased rate of elevated 
temperatures or microbiologic evaluations for possible sepsis in the first 21 days of life 
(<I>158</I>).
<H4>
<B>Adverse Events</B>
</H4>
</P><P>A causal association has been established between receipt of hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis 
(<I>159</I>). On the basis of data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project, the 
estimated incidence of anaphylaxis among children and adolescents 
who received hepatitis B vaccine is one case per 1.1 million vaccine doses distributed (95% confidence interval = 0.1--3.9) 
(<I>160</I>).
</P><P>Early postlicensure surveillance of adverse events suggested a possible association between Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome 
and receipt of the first dose of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine among U.S. adults 
(<I>161</I>). However, in a subsequent analysis of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome cases reported to CDC, FDA, and vaccine manufacturers, among an estimated 2.5 million 
adults who received <U>&gt;</U>1 dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine during 1986--1990, the rate of Guillain-Barr&eacute; 
syndrome occurring after hepatitis B vaccination did not exceed the background rate among unvaccinated persons (CDC, 
unpublished data, 1992). A review by persons with clinical expertise concluded that evidence was insufficient to reject or accept a 
causal association between Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome and hepatitis B vaccination 
(<I>159,<a href="00046738.htm">162</a></I>).
</P><P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) has not been reported after hepatitis B vaccination among children. However, one retrospective 
case-control study (<I>163,164</I>) reported an association between hepatitis B vaccine and MS among adults. Multiple other 
studies (<I>165--168</I>) have demonstrated no association between hepatitis B vaccine and MS. Reviews of these data by panels of 
persons with clinical expertise have favored rejection of a causal association between hepatitis B vaccination and MS 
(<I>169,170</I>).
</P><P>Chronic illnesses that have been reported in rare instances after hepatitis B vaccination include chronic fatigue 
syndrome (<I>171</I>), neurologic disorders (e.g., leukoencephalitis, optic neuritis, and transverse myelitis) 
(<I>172--174</I>), rheumatoid arthritis 
(<I>175,176</I>), type 1 diabetes (<I>177</I>), and autoimmune disease 
(<I>178</I>). No evidence of a causal association between these 
conditions or other chronic illnesses and hepatitis B vaccine has been demonstrated 
(<I>159,169,170,179--182</I>).
</P><P>Reported episodes of alopecia (hair loss) after rechallenge with hepatitis B vaccine suggest that vaccination might, in 
rare cases, trigger episodes of alopecia 
(<I>183</I>). However, a population-based study determined no statistically 
significant association between alopecia and hepatitis B vaccine 
(<I>184</I>).
</P><P>No evidence exists of a causal association between hepatitis B vaccination, including administration of the birth dose, 
and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other causes of death during the first year of life 
(<I>185--187</I>). Infant death rates, including rates of SIDS, declined substantially in the United States during the 1990s, coincident with an increase in 
infant 

hepatitis B vaccination coverage from &lt;1% to &gt;90% and implementation of efforts to reduce SIDS through infant 
sleep positioning and separation from other persons in bed 
(<I>188</I>).
</P><P>The safety of hepatitis B vaccine and other vaccines is 
assessed continuously through ongoing monitoring of data from VSD, 
the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), and other surveillance systems. Any adverse events after vaccination should 
be reported to VAERS; report forms and assistance are available from CDC at telephone 1-800-822-7967 or at
		<a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">http://www.vaers.hhs.gov</a>.
<H4>
<B>Contraindications and Precautions</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Hepatitis B vaccination is contraindicated for persons with a history of hypersensitivity to yeast or to any 
vaccine component (<I>92,189--191</I>). Despite a theoretic risk for allergic reaction to vaccination in persons with allergy to 
<I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> (baker's yeast), no evidence exists that documents adverse reactions after vaccination of persons with a history of 
yeast allergy.
</P><P>Persons with a history of serious adverse events (e.g., anaphylaxis) after receipt of hepatitis B vaccine should 
not receive additional doses. As with other vaccines, vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute illness, with or 
without fever, should be deferred until the acute phase of the illness resolves 
(<I><a href="rr5102a1.htm">192</a></I>). Vaccination is not contraindicated in persons with a history of 
MS, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis or rheumatoid arthritis), or other 
chronic diseases.
</P><P>Pregnancy is not a contraindication to vaccination. Limited data indicate no apparent risk for adverse events to 
developing fetuses when hepatitis B vaccine is administered to pregnant women 
(<I>193</I>). Current vaccines contain noninfectious 
HBsAg and should cause no risk to the fetus.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Future Considerations</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>Implementation of the recommendations and strategies in this document should ultimately lead to the elimination of 
HBV transmission in the United States. New information will have implications for this effort, and adjustments and changes 
are expected to occur.
<H4>
<B>Long-Term Protection and Booster Doses </B>
</H4>
</P><P>Studies are needed to assess long-term protection after vaccination and the possible need for booster doses of vaccine. 
The longest follow-up studies of vaccine protection have been conducted in populations with an initially high endemicity of 
HBV infection (i.e., <U>&gt;</U>8% prevalence of chronic infection) 
(<I>130</I>). Implementation of hepatitis B vaccination programs in 
populations with a high endemicity of HBV infection has resulted in virtual elimination of new HBV infections by providing 
vaccine-induced immunity to susceptible persons. In these populations, ongoing exposure of vaccinated persons to persons with chronic HBV infection might complicate future efforts to assess long-term hepatitis B vaccine efficacy. Assessment of efficacy provided 
by hepatitis B immunization after 15--20 years will require studies among populations that continue to have exposures to 
HBsAg-positive persons (e.g., communities of immigrants from highly endemic countries, populations of 
injection-drug users, or health-care workers) and studies among populations with a low prevalence of infection.
<H4>
<B>Immunization Escape Mutants</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Mutations in the S gene of HBV can lead to conformational changes in the 
<I>a</I> determinant of the HBsAg protein, which 
is the major target for neutralizing anti-HBs. These variants have been detected in humans infected with HBV, and concern 
has been expressed that these variants might replicate in the presence of vaccine-induced anti-HBs or anti-HBs contained 
in HBIG (<I>194,195</I>)<B>. </B>Although no evidence suggests that S gene immunization escape mutants pose a threat to existing 
programs using hepatitis B vaccines (<I>196</I>), further studies and enhanced surveillance to detect the emergence of these variants are 
high priorities for monitoring the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Recommendations for Hepatitis B Vaccination of Infants, Children, 
and Adolescents</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>This section outlines updated ACIP recommendations and associated implementation strategies for hepatitis B 
vaccination of infants, children, and adolescents. These recommendations have been summarized 
(<a href = "#box3">Box 3</a>).
<H4>
<B>Prevention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Management of Pregnant Women</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
</P><P><b>Prenatal HBsAg Testing</b>
</P><UL>
<LI>All pregnant women should be tested routinely for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit (e.g., first trimester) in each pregnancy, 
even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested.
<LI>Women who were not screened prenatally, those who 
engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for infection 
(e.g., injection-drug use, having had more than one sex partner in the previous 6 months or an HBsAg-positive sex 
partner, evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease [STD], or recent or current injection-drug use) and those 
with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery.
<LI>All laboratories that provide HBsAg testing of pregnant women should use an FDA-licensed or -approved HBsAg test 
and should perform testing according to the manufacturer's labeling, including testing of initially reactive specimens with 
a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time of admission for 
delivery, shortened testing protocols may be used and initially reactive results reported to expedite administration 
of immunoprophylaxis to infants.
<LI>Women who are HBsAg positive should be referred to an appropriate case-management program to ensure that their 
infants receive timely postexposure prophylaxis and follow-up (see Case-Management Programs to Prevent Perinatal HBV 
Infection). In addition, a copy of the original laboratory report indicating 
the pregnant woman's HBsAg status should be provided 
to the hospital where delivery is planned and to the health-care provider who will care for the newborn.
<LI>Women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with or referred for appropriate counseling and medical 
management (<a href="rr5416a2.htm">Appendix A</a>). HBsAg-positive pregnant women should receive information concerning hepatitis B that discusses
<br>
--- modes of transmission;
<br>
--- perinatal concerns (e.g., infants born to 
HBsAg-positive mothers may be breast fed); <br>
--- prevention of HBV transmission to contacts, including the importance of postexposure prophylaxis for the 
newborn infant and hepatitis B vaccination for household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts;
<br>
--- substance abuse treatment, if appropriate; and
<br>
--- medical evaluation and possible treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
<LI>When HBsAg testing of pregnant women is not feasible (i.e., in remote areas without access to a laboratory), all 
infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine 
<U>&lt;</U>12 hours of birth and should complete the hepatitis B vaccine 
series according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (<a href="#tab2">Tables 2</a> and 
<a href="#tab3">3</a>).
</UL>
<H</P><P>
<b>Management of Infants Born to Women Who Are HBsAg Positive</b>
</P><UL>
<LI>All infants born to HBsAg-positive women should receive single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (<a href = "#tab2">Table 2</a>) and HBIG 
(0.5 mL) <U>&lt;</U>12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites. The vaccine series should be completed according to 
a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (<a href = "#tab3">Table 3</a>). The final dose in the vaccine series 
should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
<LI>For preterm infants weighing &lt;2,000 g, the initial vaccine dose (birth dose) should not be counted as part of the 
vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity 
of hepatitis B vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses 
of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1 month (<a href="#tab3">Tables 3</a> and 
<a href="#tab4">4</a>).
<LI>Postvaccination testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completion of the vaccine series, at age 
9--18 months (generally at the next well-child visit). Testing should not be performed before age 9 months to avoid detection 
of anti-HBs from HBIG administered during infancy and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. 
Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in 
infants born to HBV-infected mothers to age 24 months. <br>
--- HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels <U>&gt;</U>10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management.
<br>
--- HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels &lt;10 
mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a second 3-dose series and 
retested 1--2 months after the final dose of vaccine. <br>
--- Infants who are HBsAg positive should receive appropriate follow-up (<a href="rr5416a2.htm">Appendix A</a>).

<LI>Infants of HBsAg-positive mothers may be breast fed 
beginning immediately after birth.
<LI>Although not indicated in the manufacturer's package 
labeling, HBsAg-containing combination vaccines may be used 
for infants aged <U>&gt;</U>6 weeks born to HBsAg-positive 
mothers to complete the vaccine series after receipt 
of a birth dose of single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG.
</UL>
		<P>
<b>Management of Infants Born to Women with Unknown HBsAg Status</b>
</P><UL>
<LI>Women admitted for delivery without documentation of HBsAg test results should have blood drawn and tested as 
soon as possible after admission.
<LI>While test results are pending, all infants born to women without documentation of HBsAg test results should 
receive the first dose of single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (without HBIG) 
<U>&lt;</U>12 hours of birth (<a href="#tab2">Tables 2</a> and <a href="#tab3">3</a>).
<br>
--- If the mother is determined to be HBsAg positive, her infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but no later 
than age 7 days, and the vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born 
to HBsAg-positive mothers (<a href = "#tab3">Table 3</a>).
<br>
--- If the mother is determined to be HBsAg negative, the vaccine series should be completed according to 
a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers (<a href = "#tab3">Table 3</a>).
<br>
--- If the mother has never been tested to determine her HBsAg status, the vaccine series should be completed 
according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (<a href = "#tab3">Table 3</a>). Administration of HBIG is 
not necessary for these infants.
<LI>Because of the potentially decreased immunogenicity of vaccine in preterm infants weighing &lt;2,000 g, 
these infants should receive both single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG (0.5 mL) if the mother's HBsAg status cannot 
be determined <U>&lt;</U>12 hours of birth. The birth dose of vaccine should not be counted as part of the 3 doses required 
to complete the vaccine series; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered according to 
a recommended schedule on the basis of the mother's HBsAg test result (<a href = "#tab3">Table 3</a>).
</UL>
		<P>
<b>Vaccination of Pregnant Women</b>
</P><UL>
<LI>Pregnant women who are identified as being at risk for HBV infection during pregnancy (e.g., having more than one 
sex partner during the previous 6 months, been evaluated or treated for an STD, recent or current injection-drug use, 
or having had an HBsAg-positive sex partner) should be vaccinated.
<LI>Pregnant women at risk for HBV infection during pregnancy should be counseled concerning other methods to 
prevent HBV infection.
</UL>
<H</P><P>
<B>Implementation</B>
</P><P><b>Delivery Hospital Policies and Procedures</b>
</P><UL>
<LI>All delivery hospitals should implement policies and procedures 
(<a href = "#box4">Box 4</a>) to ensure 1) identification of infants born 
to HBsAg-positive mothers and infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status (see Prenatal HBsAg Testing), and 
2) initiation of immunization for these infants. Such policies and procedures should include the following standing orders:
<br>
--- for all pregnant women, review of HBsAg test results at the time of admission for delivery;
<br>
--- for women who do not have a documented HBsAg test result, HBsAg testing as soon as possible after 
admission for delivery; <br>
--- identification and management of all infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers;
<br>
--- identification and management of all infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status; and
<br>
--- for all infants, documentation on the infant's medical record of maternal HBsAg test results, infant hepatitis B 
vaccine administration, and administration of HBIG (if appropriate).

<LI>Delivery hospitals should enroll in the federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to obtain free hepatitis 
B vaccine for administration of the birth dose to newborns who are eligible (i.e., Medicaid eligible, American Indian 
or Alaska Native, underinsured, or uninsured).
</UL>
		<P>
<b>Case-Management Programs to Prevent Perinatal HBV Infection</b>
</P><UL>
<LI>States and localities should establish case-management programs 
(<a href = "#box5">Box 5</a>), including appropriate policies, procedures, 
laws, and regulations, to ensure that
<br>
--- all pregnant women are tested for HBsAg during each pregnancy, and <br>
--- infants born to HBsAg-positive women and infants born to women with unknown HBsAg status 
receive recommended case management.
<LI>The location of these programs and the methods by which they operate will depend on multiple factors (e.g., 
population density and annual caseload of HBsAg-positive women). Programs may be located in state or local health 
departments, private health-care systems (e.g., health maintenance organizations), or institutions (e.g., correctional facility 
systems). Program administrators will need to work with prenatal care providers, delivery hospital staff, pediatric care 
providers, private health-care systems, and health departments.
</UL>
<H<H4>
<B>Universal Vaccination of Infants</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
</P><UL>
<LI>All infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine series as part of the recommended childhood immunization 
schedule (<a href = "#tab5">Table 5</a> and <a href="rr5416a3.htm">Appendix B</a>). (For recommendations on management of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and 
infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status, see Prevention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Management of 
Pregnant Women.)
<LI>For all medically stable infants weighing 
<U>&gt;</U>2,000 g at birth and born to HBsAg-negative mothers, the first dose of 
vaccine should be administered before hospital discharge. Only single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine should be used for the 
birth dose.
<LI>On a case-by-case basis and only in rare circumstances, the first dose may be delayed until after hospital discharge for 
an infant who weighs <U>&gt;</U>2,000 g and whose mother is HBsAg negative. <br>
--- When such a decision is made, a physician's order to withhold the birth dose and a copy of the original 
laboratory report indicating that the mother was HBsAg negative during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's 
medical record. <br>
--- For infants who do not receive a first dose before hospital discharge, the first dose should be administered no later 
than age 2 months.
<br>
--- Situations in which the birth dose should not be 
delayed include any high-risk sexual or drug-using practices of 
the infant's mother during pregnancy (e.g., having had more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months or 
an HBsAg-positive sex partner, evaluation or treatment for an STD, or recent or current injection-drug use) and 
expected poor compliance with follow-up to initiate the vaccine series.
<LI>Preterm infants weighing &lt;2,000 g and born to HBsAg-negative mothers should have their first vaccine dose 
delayed until 1 month after birth or hospital discharge (<a href = "#tab4">Table 4</a>). For these infants, a copy of the original laboratory report 
indicating that the mother was HBsAg negative during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's medical record.
<LI>The vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule with either single-antigen vaccine or 
a combination vaccine that contains the hepatitis B vaccine antigen (e.g., Hib-hepatitis B or 
DTaP-IPV-hepatitis B) (<a href = "#tab2">Table 2</a>). The final dose in the vaccine series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
<LI>Administration of 4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine to 
infants is permissible in certain situations (e.g., when 
combination vaccines are administered after the birth dose).
<LI>In populations with currently or previously high rates of childhood HBV infection (i.e., Alaska Natives; Pacific 
Islanders; and immigrant families from Asia, Africa, and other regions with intermediate or high endemic rates of infection [<a href = "#fig1">Figure 1</a> and <a href = "#box2">Box 2</a>]), the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at birth and the final dose at age 6--12 months.

</UL>
<H</P><P>
<B>Implementation</B>
</P><UL>
<LI>All delivery hospitals should implement standing orders for administration of hepatitis B vaccination as part of 
routine medical care of all medically stable infants weighing 
<U>&gt;</U>2,000 g at birth (<a href = "#box4">Box 4</a>).
<LI>All delivery hospitals should implement policies and procedures for management of infants weighing &lt;2,000 g at 
birth, including the following: <br>
--- ensuring initiation of postexposure immunization of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and infants born 
to mothers not screened for HBsAg prenatally (see Prevention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Management of 
Pregnant Women), and <br>
--- documentation of maternal HBsAg test results on the infant's medical record.
<LI>Prenatal care education should include information 
regarding the rationale for and importance of newborn hepatitis 
B vaccination.
<LI>States are encouraged to adopt regulations or laws that require hepatitis B vaccination for entry into child care and also 
for entry into kindergarten and/or elementary school to ensure high vaccine coverage among infants and children.
</UL>
<H<H4>
<B>Vaccination of Children and Adolescents Who Were Not Previously Vaccinated</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
</P><UL>
<LI>Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all children and adolescents aged &lt;19 years.
<LI>Children and adolescents who have not previously received hepatitis B vaccine should be vaccinated routinely at any 
age with an appropriate dose and schedule (<a href="#tab2">Tables 2</a> and 
<a href="#tab5">5</a>). Selection of a vaccine schedule should consider the need 
to achieve completion of the vaccine series. In all settings, vaccination should be initiated even though completion of 
the vaccine series might not be ensured.
</UL>
<H</P><P>
<B>Implementation</B>
</P><UL>
<LI>To ensure high vaccination coverage among children and adolescents, the following measures are recommended:
<br>
--- All children aged 11--12 years should have a review of their immunization records and should complete the 
vaccine series if they were not previously vaccinated or were incompletely vaccinated.
<br>
--- All children and adolescents aged &lt;19 years (including internationally adopted children) who were born in Asia, 
the Pacific Islands, Africa, or other intermediate- or high-endemic countries (<a href = "#fig1">Figure 1</a> and 
<a href = "#box2">Box 2</a>) or who have at least 
one parent who was born in one of these areas should have a review of their immunization records and should complete 
the vaccine series if they were not previously vaccinated or were incompletely vaccinated.
<br>
--- States are encouraged to adopt regulations or laws that require hepatitis B vaccination before entry into middle 
school or its equivalent.
<br>
--- Vaccination requirements should be considered for older high school students and for students before college 
entry, when feasible.
<br>
--- States are encouraged to expand or implement immunization registries to include adolescents.
<br>
--- Hepatitis B vaccine should be offered to all unvaccinated adolescents in settings that provide health-care services to 
this age group (<a href = "#box6">Box 6</a>), particularly those who engage in behaviors that place them at high risk for HBV infection.
