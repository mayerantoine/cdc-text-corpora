            "abstract": "Introduction Nutrition counseling is important for veterans undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the number of nutrition visits a patient attended and change in body mass index (BMI) after gastric bypass surgery for the veteran population. Methods A retrospective study examined veterans (N = 79) who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery from June 2004 through July 2010. Spearman's correlation and multivariate regression analysis were used to analyze data. Results A significant correlation was found between the number of postoperative nutrition visits and the change in postsurgery BMI at 2 years (Spearman's ρ = 0.21; P = .017). After adjusting for age, sex, and race, the association between postsurgery nutrition visits and BMI change persisted (β = 0.255; 95% confidence interval, 0.015–0.581; P = .039). Conclusion Veterans with more nutrition visits following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery experienced greater declines in BMI. This finding underscores the importance of the dietitian on the bariatric surgery team."

            "title": "Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages and Liquor Consumption by Michigan High School Students, 2011",
            "abstract": "Introduction Excessive alcohol consumption was responsible for approximately 4,300 annual deaths in the United States among people younger than 21 from 2006 through 2010. Underage drinking cost the United States $24.6 billion in 2006. Previous studies have shown that liquor is the most common type of alcohol consumed by high school students. However, little is known about the types of liquor consumed by youth or about the mixing of alcohol with energy drinks. Methods The 2011 Michigan Youth Tobacco Survey was used to assess usual alcohol beverage consumption and liquor consumption and the mixing of alcohol with energy drinks by Michigan high school students. Beverage preferences were analyzed by demographic characteristics and drinking patterns. Results Overall, 34.2% of Michigan high school students consumed alcohol in the past month, and 20.8% reported binge drinking. Among current drinkers, liquor was the most common type of alcohol consumed (51.2%), and vodka was the most prevalent type of liquor consumed by those who drank liquor (53.0%). The prevalence of liquor consumption was similar among binge drinkers and nonbinge drinkers, but binge drinkers who drank liquor were significantly more likely than nonbinge drinkers to consume vodka and to mix alcohol with energy drinks (49.0% vs 18.2%, respectively). Conclusions Liquor is the most common type of alcoholic beverage consumed by Michigan high school students; vodka is the most common type of liquor consumed. Mixing alcohol and energy drinks is common, particularly among binge drinkers. Community Guide strategies for reducing excessive drinking (eg, increasing alcohol taxes) can reduce underage drinking."

            "abstract": "Introduction Effective communication approaches are necessary to reach food-security program participants. Accessing food-security programs has been especially challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media can play an important role in reducing some communication barriers. We examined interest in receiving nutrition information via social media among adults participating in food-security programs in Washington, DC. Methods We developed and administered a 22-item survey to adults participating in food-security programs (N = 375). Participants were recruited at Martha's Table, in Washington, DC, from January through March 2020. We performed bivariate analyses and multinomial logistic regressions to examine predictors of interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. Results Sixty-nine percent of participants reported using social media, and 49% expressed interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. Higher levels of self-efficacy and belief in the value of digital technology were associated with greater likelihood of interest in receiving nutrition information via social media (χ26 = 139.0; Nagelkerke R2 = 0.35; P < .001). We found no differences by sex or digital technology access in interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. Conclusion Social media is a widely used and a feasible method to reach food-security program participants. Understanding program participants' interest in receiving health information via social media may help food-security programs plan effective communication strategies to improve food security, especially when in-person participation is limited, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "abstract": "Introduction Clustering of fast-food restaurants around schools facilitates fast-food consumption among students, which may cause obesity. We examined the prevalence of fast-food restaurants and identified the clusters of fast-food restaurants near secondary schools in Hong Kong. Methods We collected data of Western fast-food chain restaurants and 490 secondary schools in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics and buffer analysis identified the prevalence of fast-food restaurants around the secondary schools within 400-m and 800-m buffers. Additional analyses compared schools stratified by the 3 main regions in Hong Kong, district-level population density, and median monthly household income. We used Getis-Ord GI* hot spot analysis to measure spatial clusters of fast-food restaurants around schools and Global Moran's I to measure the spatial autocorrelation based on each school and the number of fast-food restaurants within the 400-m buffer. Results The average number of fast-food restaurants within 400 m and 800 m of a school was 2.0 and 6.3, respectively. Seven in 10 secondary schools had at least 1 fast-food restaurant within 400 m. The number of schools with no fast-food restaurants was higher in Hong Kong Island, considered the \"rich region\" in Hong Kong. Hot spots of clusters were significantly located in the high-density downtown areas. We observed significant spatial autocorrelation between fast-food restaurants and secondary schools in the areas with high density, low income, and high income (P < .001, z > 2.58). Conclusion Fast-food restaurants were substantially clustered around secondary schools in Hong Kong. Territory-wide studies about the health effect of fast-food clusters around schools on children and adolescents are warranted in Hong Kong."

            "abstract": "Introduction Many studies document that overweight and obese adults have substantially higher medical care expenditures than do adults of normal weight, but comparable data for children or adolescents are few. This study examines patterns of expenditure for medical care and use of medical care services among a sample of North Carolina adolescents enrolled in Medicaid, stratified by body mass index categories. Methods North Carolina public health records, which include clinically measured height and weight, were linked to 2004 North Carolina Medicaid enrollment records to find adolescents aged 12–18 years whose records matched. We then examined all paid claims for 2004 of the 3528 adolescents whose records matched. Total expenditures by sex and race, hospital costs, physician costs, and prescription drug costs were tabulated and stratified by body mass index. We also examined, by body mass index, the percentage of adolescents who had a paid claim for selected diagnosed health conditions. Results Overall, and for most demographic and service categories, overweight adolescents and at-risk-for-overweight adolescents had higher average Medicaid expenditures than did normal-weight adolescents. Some of these differences were statistically significant. Overweight adolescents were significantly more likely to have a paid claim for services related to diabetes, asthma, or other respiratory conditions. Conclusion Although based on a small sample, our results suggest that overweight has negative health consequences as early as adolescence. Further studies with larger samples could help confirm the findings of our study."

            "abstract": "Background The death rate from colorectal cancer is high and affects poor and medically underserved populations disproportionately. In the United States, health disparities are particularly acute in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region. Because many in the region have limited access to basic health care resources, they are not screened for cancer, even though screening is one of the most effective strategies to prevent colorectal cancer. Community-based participatory research is a promising approach to prevent colorectal cancer in this population. Community Context The Empowering Communities for Life program was implemented in 2 underserved counties in the Arkansas Lower Mississippi River Delta. The program arose from a 9-year partnership between the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and 9 cancer councils across Arkansas. Methods Empowering Communities for Life is a community-based participatory intervention designed to increase colorectal cancer screening in rural, underserved communities through fecal occult blood testing. Community and academic partners collaborated to develop research infrastructure, intervention materials and methods, and the assessment instrument. Outcome Project outcomes were strengthened community-academic partnerships, certification of community partners in conducting human subjects research, development of a randomized controlled design to test the intervention's efficacy, an interactive PowerPoint presentation, an informational pamphlet, the certification of 6 lay health advisors and 22 role models to provide the intervention, and an assessment tool using an audience response system. Interpretation Lessons learned in working collaboratively with diverse groups include the importance of meeting face to face and listening."
